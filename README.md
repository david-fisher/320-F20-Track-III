# 320-F20-Track-III
Ethisim is a website that allows you to easily create and assign ethics
simulations. Run them for a participation grade, or
develop them further into longer discussions for class.

This is Track III's repository containing code for both the front-end and back-end of Ethisim. This README provides instruction on how to install and setup both the front-end and back-end in order to get the software running.

## How to get the Front-end Running
1. Download node.js version 12.18.4 and npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
2. Clone the Github repository
3. cd into the ethisim folder
4. Run npm install, This should install all dependencies if this doesn't work see section below
5. To run the front-end, use npm start to run the development build at local host:3000
6. You are done, but note that you will need to have the back-end running as well for the front-end to connect to the database and see current scenarios on the dashboard

### You can complete all of these steps by just using npm install
#### Install Dependencies
    - npm install react@16.13.1
    - npm install react-device-detect@1.14.0
    - npm install react-dom@16.13.1
    - npm install react-flow-renderer@6.1.3
    - npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0
    - npm install react-scripts@3.4.4
    - npm install @material-ui/core@4.11.0
    - npm install @material-ui/icons@4.9.1
    - npm install @material-ui/lab@4.0.0-alpha.56
    - npm install @testing-library/jest-dom@5.11.4
    - npm install @testing-library/react@11.0.4
    - npm install @testing-library/user-event@12.1.6
    - npm install axios@0.21.0
    - npm install start@5.1.0
    - npm install suneditor-react@2.14.2

#### How to install Prettier, Eslint and Husky
    1. Npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier will install prettier
    2. Make sure to install eslint before installing eslint-config-prettier which allows prettier and eslint to work together nicely
    3. Npm install eslint --save-dev will install eslint
    4. Run npx eslint --init to set up an configuration file
       - Questions will appear and the directions tell you to use arrow keys to select an answer even though the arrow keys don’t work.
       Think of the options presented to you in each question as an array starting at 0 or 1.
       If you want for example option one out of three for the second question,
       then type in 0 to the command line and press enter and that should select the answer that you want.
       - Answer all the questions before moving forward, if you mess up on one of the answers, just press Ctrl^C and re-run the npx eslint --init command
    5. You might also need to install eslint-plugin-react@latest, if so follow the directions on the command line after finishing the previous step
    6. Make sure prettier and eslint are both installed  before we run npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier so prettier and eslint will work together nicely with each other
    7. Then, add eslint-config-prettier to the "extends" array in your .eslintrc.* file. Make sure to put it last, so it gets the chance to override other configs. It might already be there.
    { "extends": [ "some-other-config-you-use", "prettier"]}
    8. To install Husky Make sure Prettier is installed and is in your devDependencies before you proceed and then run npx mrm lint-staged
    9. This will install husky and lint-staged, then add a configuration to the project’s package.json that will automatically format supported files in a pre-commit hook. After this step you are done


## How to get the Back-end Running
### On MAC
1. Install python3 https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. sudo pip3 install pipenv (do it globally)
3. pipenv shell
4. pipenv install django djangorestframework django-rest-knox\
5. pipenv install django-filter (or pip3 install django-filter)
6. pip install psycopg2 (or pip install django psycopg2 or pip install psycopg2-binary or pipenv run pip3 install psycopg2-binary)
7. pip install django-cors-headers
8. cd lead
9. python3 manage.py runserver

#### How to run server on MAC:
1. Go to moral_kombat_backend directory
2. pipenv shell
3. cd lead
4. python3 manage.py runserver

### On WINDOWS
1. https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Checkmark all optional features, add Python to environment variables)
2. Open Terminal
3. (IF RUN INTO ERRORS INSERT py -m before each command)
4. pip install pipwin
5. pipwin install psycopg2
6. pip install django djangorestframework django-rest-knox
7. pip install django-filter (or pip3 install django-filter)
8. Might need to download https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

#### How to run server on Windows:
1. Go to moral_kombat_backend directory
2. cd moral_kombat_backend
3. cd lead
4. py -m manage.py runserver

### TEST The back-end:
Go to postman and send a GET request to http://localhost:8000/api/scenarios (Should get Array of scenarios)




## API Endpoints and Rest Documentation
You can find the list of endpoints here at:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSiUe21Z_TgT5XZKyR0twevRM864_AswxzVdYLwqW1I/edit?usp=sharing

To see REST Documentation run both the front-end and back-end and type http://localhost:8000
